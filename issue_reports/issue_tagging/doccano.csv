,1976,144,,,,,"Magic variable role_names to also list roles belonged to via dependencies?

ISSUE TYPE

Feature Idea

ANSIBLE VERSION
ansible 2.0.2.0 (not that relevant here though)
COMPONENT NAME
magic variables
SUMMARY
The magic variable role_names, containing the list of all role names that the current target of the playbook belongs to, is quite useful in certain scenarios. For example, I use the same playbook to set up development vagrant VMs as well as test and production servers. A few tasks in certain roles are conditional on role membership, e.g. having when: ""'dev' in role_names"".
However, it looks like roles that are included via role dependencies in meta/main.yml files are not included in the role_names list. You could make an argument either way, but it seems to me that they should be there for completeness' sake, since role membership via dependency is still a type of role membership.
Seeing as role_names isn't really documented (""role_names"" site:docs.ansible.com on Google returns nothing, at least), it probably isn't very widely used right now, and changing the behaviour probably won't break much. Is this something you could consider?",3

SUMMARY
When downloading an artifact you can ask the module to determine the latest version automatically (it gets extracted from the repo's metadata). The artifact's name in the repository comes with a version string which currently gets overwritten with 'latest' when downloading.
The problem with this approach is that you sometimes need to know what version the downloaded artifact has for further processing, My use case is transferring the version to the RPM that I build from it.
STEPS TO REPRODUCE
The implementation should introduce an additional parameter which causes what I described above. This is only relevant for the constellation version: latest and dest being a directory, because else the filename chosen by dest or the version explicitly selected win.

        keep_name: yes
EXPECTED RESULTS
The downloaded artifact contains the dynamically determined version string. In this case, the last version found in this list. At the moment of creating this issue this is /tmp/spring-core-4.3.7.RELEASE.jar
ACTUAL RESULTS
The downloaded artifact is renamed to /tmp/spring-core-latest.jar",2

I fixed it by instead doing:

The issue ended up being that I missed a ':' between a variable key and value. I assume that this can be reproduced by leaving off a colon anywhere in a variable definition (or maybe even tasks). I specifically created this  it by creating a vars section and putting:
---
variable value
I fixed it by instead doing:
---
variable: value
@mpdehaan mentioned that this would be a pretty quick fix.",2

In the password_hash filter function the underlying passlib call uses the default rounds parameter.
The default for glibc is 5000, the passlib default for sha512 is 656000. This means on a login in a linux account the hash calculation will take significantly longer.
Actually you get basically no rounds parameter when setting it to 5000

    if peek_result['state'] == 'absent':
KeyError: 'state'

The problem appears to be because the --diff command is relying upon the existence of a 'state' key in the returned JSON. This appears to be a key added in the module_utils.basic Python module, specifically the add_path_info method, which seems to be called by load_common_file_arguments. I was going to just hack this into win_copy, but it seems to me that the most reasonable solution would be to add load_common_file_arguments to powershell_common.ps1. I'm more than happy to start work on that if the community agrees that is the best answer.",3

    if peek_result['state'] == 'absent':
KeyError: 'state'

The problem appears to be because the --diff command is relying upon the existence of a 'state' key in the returned JSON. This appears to be a key added in the module_utils.basic Python module, specifically the add_path_info method, which seems to be called by load_common_file_arguments. I was going to just hack this into win_copy, but it seems to me that the most reasonable solution would be to add load_common_file_arguments to powershell_common.ps1. I'm more than happy to start work on that if the community agrees that is the best answer.",2

My ansible's 'include' statement was working fine, but recently after including ymls in subfolder, it somehow brokes the role's path.

 - name: Install httpd
   include: httpd.yml

 - name: Including specific tasks
   include: ""{{ profile }}/main.yml"" 

Prior to this point, it works just fine. But the next step, after including the ""profile""/main.yml, brokes the role's path.
roles/webservers/tasks/dev/main.yml:
 - name:  Create httpd.conf from template
   template: src=httpd_conf.j2 dest=/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

FATAL: all hosts have already failed -- aborting

So, after this 'include', it somehow thinks that role's root is located in 'webservers/tasks/', instead of 'webservers/'. But in the same time, it sees the variables in 'webservers/vars/' path.
Moreover, it was working fine and recently just broke. I haven't updated ansible, nor edited it's parameters, just updated the playbook.
If I specify the 'src=../../templates/httpd_conf.j2' it works fine, but since this behaviour just appeared like from nowhere, I can't rely on this path.
I've managed to use this workaround: template: src=""{{ role_path }}/templates/httpd_conf.j2"" dest=/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf But that's a workaround. The reason of auto-pathing is broke is still undiscovered.

Issue Type: Feature Idea
Ansible Version: ansible 1.6.6
Environment: N/A
Summary:
When variables are accessed through hostvars, jinja2 expressions inside those variables should be interpolated.
There was discussion about this issue on ansible-project mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/ansible-project/pdWFR2Q8U8E/m6sgB1C5K1YJ
And here is a filter that shows simple implementation (but might be pretty slow, and I think it should be in hostvars not a filter): https://groups.google.com/group/ansible-project/attach/16318558e74073ae/hostvars.py?part=0.1&view=1
Steps To Reproduce:
Given vars like:
foo: y
bar: ""x is {{ foo }}""

The values for both {{ bar }} and {{ hostvars[some_host].bar }} should be ""x is y"".
Currently the value of {{ hostvars[some_host].bar }} would be (literally) ""x is {{ foo }}"".",3

Feature Idea

ANSIBLE VERSION

SUMMARY
using ""file"" to check for directories (or links) is not very intuitive.

,2004,140,,,,,"Add a way to make boto not verify SSL certs

Starting a year ago with version 2.6.0, boto began verifying servers' SSL certificates by default.  Since most Eucalyptus and Nova installs have self-signed certs, this breaks Ansible's AWS-related modules when they're pointed at one of those clouds using a relatively current version of boto.
They added a validate_certs=False arg to calls like boto.connect_ec2_endpoint one can use to disable this behavior, but right now Ansible doesn't have a way to trigger that.  Modules like ec2, ec2_elb, and so on would benefit from a parameter that lets one turn cert verification off when they need to talk to services with self-signed certs.

Hi,
I did post this in the Google forum, but my post never seemed to appear so asking here now instead.
This is probably something that isn't recommended but I'm trying to copy some PEM keys to a destination server so that they can be used by that server at a later time.
I need to make sure that they are set to a mode of 400 as well, so using the following code:
- name: add default ssh keys
  become: true
  copy:
    src: ./.ssh/
    dest: ~/.ssh
    mode: 400
    force: true

I would hope and expect to see the following when listing the files on the destination server:
-r--------

But instead I'm seeing the following:
-rw--w----

Any particular reason why the files being uploaded are actually getting the incorrect permissions?
Or is there a different approach to making sure these files have the correct permissions?
Thanks,
Gary",3

Ansible Version:
1.9.4
Ansible Configuration:

Environment:

Summary:
See the project structure below
Steps To Reproduce:
I have the following project structure:

      media/
        main.yml [2]

[1] main.yml has content:
- include: media/main.yml tags=media
[2] main.yml has content:
- include: hipchat.yml tags=hipchat
- include: slack.yml tags=slack
...

Expected Results:
I expect all tasks from media/main.yml will inherit all tags specified in tasks/main.yml. So, if I run ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml --tags media, it will run all tasks specified in media/main.yml, and $ ansible-playbook --list-tags -i hosts site.yml reports this tag as well

P.S.1: The whole source code of the project is available here https://github.com/zshamrock/ididitagain
P.S.2: As a workaround (or the right way to do?), move specific subdirectories, like media, dev, dot-files, etc, in its own roles, and assign tags with role instead, as mentioned here http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_tags.html in my site.yml?

Issue Type:
Bug Report
Ansible Version:
ansible 1.6 (devel 317c2f4) last updated 2014/04/03 12:41:29 (GMT +200)
Environment:
openSUSE 12.2 (x86_64)
Summary:
Using the synchronize action while deploying to a VM listening on localhost confuses ansible as it tries to unnecessarily delegate to localhost, and also forgets to clear the port.
Steps To Reproduce:
I'm running a simple playbook to deploy some software to a VM running on localhost:2222.
Inventory file:
[localvm]
localhost ansible_ssh_user=root ansible_ssh_port=2222

tasks/main.yml:
- name: Install via rsync
  synchronize: src=../pkg dest=/srv/pkg/

This fails because it tries to connect to 127.0.0.1:2222 with my current username. What is happening, apparently, is that it assumes I'm doing a delegate action and tries to connect to localhost with my current username, but retains the faulty port. There is no need to delegate at all.
Expected Results:
I'd assume it would simply run rsync locally, without delegation, to deploy to the VM.
Actual Results:
It fails because it tries to run an ssh connection to <username>@127.0.0.1 port 2222, which does not work because <username> does not exist on the VM, and port 2222 is the VM. It would succeed on port 22, but that's not necessary.
The following change also makes the above work for me, so it is indeed some bogus delegation business. (The second hunk is only necessary because the first change removes the conn.delegate attribute.)

I wasn't sure if this was a bug or intended behavior. When I think about the issue, it seems more intuitive that you'd use the same name that you would for a host in your inventory and expect Ansible to use the same connection details when running the task.
Issue Type: Bug Report
Ansible Version: 1.7
Environment: Arch to drive, managing Ubuntu 12.04
Summary:
When running a task with delegate_to it doesn't look the provided host up in the inventory. You can pass it anything and it will try to SSH to it. Since that's the case it also doesn't properly look up the ansible_ssh_port for the delegated host.
Steps To Reproduce:
Hosts File:
(Using 127.0.0.1 as an example, but assume that's a WAN IP with a bunch of NAT one-to-many forwards.)
 host1 ansible_ssh_host=127.0.0.1 ansible_ssh_port=22
 host2 ansible_ssh_host=127.0.0.1 ansible_ssh_port=22222

      delegate_to: host2

    - name: Do The Delegationating, Part Deux
      shell: echo 'If you see this in your syslog maybe someone should disable passwordless root logins at the googles.'
      delegate_to: google.com

Expected Results:
changed: [host1 -> host2] => {""changed"": true, ""cmd"": ""hostname"", ""stderr"": """", ""stdout"": ""host2""}
fatal: [host1 -> google.com] => Host google.com ain't all up in your inventory.

Actual Results:
changed: [host1 -> host2] => {""changed"": true, ""cmd"": ""hostname"", ""stderr"": """", ""stdout"": ""host1""}
fatal: [host1 -> google.com] => SSH encountered an unknown error during the connection. We recommend you re-run the command using -vvvv, which will enable SSH debugging output to help diagnose the issue

In following situatation, I'd like to have some kind of error report, but now the connection just got stuck.

,2034,144,,,,,"New keyword for 'with_sequence' in order to skip task if count < 0 or start > end

Issue Type: Feature request
Ansible Version: 1.8.4
Environment: N/A
Summary:
When using with_sequence ""programmatically"" (i.e., in combination with variables), it would be useful to allow a negative value for the count argument, or a start value that is larger than end. Currently this results in an error (""can't count backwards""), but it could be useful to simply skip the task if the range is empty. This could be achieved by adding an extra keyword, e.g. skip_with_emtpy_range (although it should probably be less verbose), which would be False by default for backwards compatibility.
Example:
---
- hosts: all
  gather_facts: False
  vars:
    - M: 2
    - N: 1
  tasks:
    - name: This taks should be skipped because 'skip_with_empty_range' is True.
      command: echo ""Hello world""
      with_sequence: start={{ M }} end={{ N }} skip_with_empty_range=True
      #with_sequence: count={{ M - N }} skip_with_empty_range=True
Expected Results:
The task should be skipped because skip_with_empty_range is True:
TASK: [This taks should be skipped because 'skip_with_empty_range' is True.] *** 
skipping: [localhost]

Actual Results:
Currently the task fails with the error message ""can't count backwards"" (of course, skip_with_emtpy_range needs to be omitted when running the example above because it is not supported yet).
TASK: [This taks should be skipped because 'skip_with_empty_range' is True.] ***

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
In /etc/profile.d/required_env_vars.sh --
DEPLOY_DIR=/myhome/deployments
In testPlaybook.yml
deploy_dir = ""{{ ansible_env.DEPLOY_DIR }}/RT{{rt_number}}""
where rt_number is defined via vars_prompt
This fails because DEPLOY_DIR is not found in the output of the setup command for the host (looked in the ansible_env), but HOME is. So it looks like Ansible is unable to use environment variables defined in a profile.d script.
As a work-around, I added an [all:vars] section the inventories/poc/hosts file --
[all:vars]
deploy_dir = $HOME/deployments --> did not work
deploy_dir = /myhome/deployments --> worked
deploy_dir = $DEPLOY_DIR --> did not work
deploy_dir = ""{{ ansible_env.DEPLOY_DIR }}"" --> did not work
Since the second one worked (hardcoded value), I removed the [all:vars] section and used an inventories/poc/group_vars/all file --
deploy_dir = /myhome/deployments

ValueError: dictionary update sequence element #0 has length 1; 2 is required
On my target server, I also tried to set up DEPLOY_DIR as an environment variable in various places --

/etc/environment -- which is not preferred because it can't do variable interpolation (only key=val pairs, no variables on the right hand side). The output of the env command showed the variables I defined as expected.
/etc/profile -- The output of the env command showed the variables defined also.
/etc/profile.d/required_env_vars.sh -- this is preferred because I'd like to keep /etc/profile the same across all servers, and just add custom environment variables via profile.d script. The output of the env command DID NOT show the variables defined, but doing ""echo $variable"" showed the expected value

None of these affected the content of ansible_env (I thought ansible_env would get the variables if the were returned by the ""env"" command?).
So it looks like Ansible does not include all the environment variables defined in its ""environment"" (ansible_env).
UPDATE 1
Okay. My bad. I changed the content of group_vars/all to use a colon instead of an equal and it worked.
deploy_dir : /home/b013000915/deployments
Got confused because in some cases (e.g. facts.d content, some modules), I had to use an equal sign.
But the other issue (not getting some of the environment variables defined) still persists.
UPDATE 2
I also tried using lookup to get the value of the following variables on the target node but it did not work for custom variables (defined via /etc/profile)
In /etc/profile
DEPLOY_DIR=/myhome/deployments
In testPlaybook.yml

name: check using lookup env

I have a simple inventory with four hosts (master1, master2, slave1, slave2) in two different groups (app-server, app-slave). When I use a host-pattern to select one group (e.g. app-server) and specify a host with --limit, ansible just selects all hosts. It does not matter if the host is contained in the selected group.
Steps To Reproduce:
hosts:
[app-server]
master1
master2

[app-slave]
slave1
slave2

Run some module with this inventory, use a host-pattern and limit it with a host. E.g:
ansible -i hosts -m debug -a ""msg=foo"" app-slave -l master1
ansible -i hosts -m debug -a ""msg=foo"" app-slave -l slave1

SUMMARY

Change Ansible's variable precedence so that groups_vars and host_vars can override all role variables. Roles should be considered standalone or isolated modules and maintain there own variable precedence. Roles can use conditions to set OS specific variables in their vars folder. All variables defined in a role should be able to be overridden outside of the role by group_vars and host_vars. This would take care of the use case for being able to set OS specific variable defaults in a role and being able to override them.

Summary:

In my case returns

Bug Report
Ansible Version:
ansible 1.6 (devel 9da26da) last updated 2014/03/18 11:15:04 (GMT +1000)
Environment:
N/A
Summary:
If you define a group containing another group without the :children, then the intended group is a host, but will also become a group when defining its contents.
The net result is that the host that should inherit characteristics of several layers of parents will not inherit those characteristics as the definitions will be:
grandparent -> parent(host)
parent(group) -> host
rather than
grandparent -> parent -> host
I believe that it should not be possible to define a group with the same name as a host (or at least a warning suggesting it might not be what you want should happen)

Summary:
Dear Ansible Dev Team,
While migrating code from old ${...} variable expansion to new Jinja2 style {{...}}, I've noticed some incompatibilities with the previous syntax, while I would expect {{...}} be a full equivalent of ${...}, i.e the following case should work just fine:
- name: Java JDK installation
  action: yum2 name=""{{ item }}"" enablerepo=acc-external-do state=installed
  with_items:
     -   - jdk{{ jdk_pro }} jdk{{ jdk_6 }} jdk{{ jdk_7 }} {{ jdk_next }}


where jdk_next is a list of values:
jdk_pro: 1.7.0_45
jdk_6: 1.6.0_43
jdk_7: 1.7.0_45
jdk_next:
  - jdk1.7.0_45

Unfortunately, it does not work.
Steps To Reproduce:

Create the playbook, which uses roles, for example server.yml:

-
  hosts: server
  gather_facts: yes
  user: root
  vars:
    local_to_opt: yes
  roles:
    - base

And put the mentioned vars in role's ""base"" vars/ and mentioned task in role's ""base"" tasks/, as it should be.

Execute ansible playbook.

 ansible-playbook --connection=local server.yml

Expected Results:
With previous syntax:
- name: Java JDK installation
  action: yum2 name=""{{ item }}"" enablerepo=acc-external-do state=installed
  with_items:
    - jdk{{ jdk_pro }} jdk{{ jdk_6 }} jdk{{ jdk_7 }} ${jdk_next}

- the result is just fine:
PLAY [server] *****************************************************************

127.0.0.1                  : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0   

Actual Results:
With the code written in Jinja2 style, I've received with the bad result:
PLAY [server] ***************************************************************** 

GATHERING FACTS *************************************************************** 
ok: [127.0.0.1]

TASK: [base | Java JDK installation] ******************************************

msg: ['jdk1.7.0_45'] packages has been failed for installation;

FATAL: all hosts have already failed -- aborting

PLAY RECAP ********************************************************************

127.0.0.1                  : ok=1    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=1   

Then, even more interesting: I found, that it's not possible anymore specify variable enclosed in {{..}} as a first member of iteration sequence like this:
- name: Java JDK installation
  action: yum2 name=""{{ item }}"" enablerepo=acc-external-do state=installed
  with_items:
    - {{ jdk_next }} jdk{{ jdk_pro }} jdk{{ jdk_6 }} jdk{{ jdk_7 }}

The result is a syntax error:
ERROR: Syntax Error while loading YAML script, /var/lib/ansible/roles/base/tasks/main.yml
Note: The error may actually appear before this position: line 596, column 22

  with_items:
    - {{ jdk_next }} jdk{{ jdk_pro }} jdk{{ jdk_6 }} jdk{{ jdk_7 }} ${jdk_next}

While the old syntax was ok:
PLAY [server] ***************************************************************** 

GATHERING FACTS *************************************************************** 
ok: [127.0.0.1]

TASK: [base | Java JDK installation] ****************************************** 
ok: [127.0.0.1] => (item=jdk1.7.0_45 jdk1.7.0_45 jdk1.6.0_43 jdk1.7.0_45 jdk1.7.0_45)

PLAY RECAP ******************************************************************** 
127.0.0.1                  : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0   

Quick debug & hacking showed the following things:

if you use original anisble syntax, the file expansion string, which arrives in the variable varname of the template() function of utils/template.py, is [u'jdk1.7.0_45 jdk1.6.0_43 jdk1.7.0_45 jdk1.7.0_45'], which is correct
if you use jinja2 syntax, the final expansion string, which arrives in the variable varname of the template() function of utils/template.py is [u""jdk1.7.0_45 jdk1.6.0_43 jdk1.7.0_45 ['jdk1.7.0_45']""] which is incorrect.

I do not have comments about SyntaxError I've provided earlier as I have no time to debug it :(
Workaround
This hack is acceptable but still ugly - the idea is to use the join() Jinja2 filter, i.e. the following code:
- name: Java JDK installation
  action: yum2 name=""{{ item }}"" enablerepo=acc-external-do state=installed
  with_items:
    - jdk{{ jdk_pro }} jdk{{ jdk_6 }} jdk{{ jdk_7 }} {{ jdk_next | join(' ') }}

works:

Run the homebrew installer script.

Note that the installer does not (and should not) create /usr/local/Cellar, this is created when the first brew package is installed. So right now no Cellar exists.

Try running a simple playbook with localhost inventory:

You'll get something that completes instantly, seems to indicate ack was installed(ok), but it wasn't. No Cellar exists. ack is seriously not installed.
Now go ahead and make the /usr/local/Cellar directory. Run the config again. Boom, suddenly it actually works. There is a noticeable delay as ack is installed and ack immediately works after the playbook completes.
Try deleting the Cellar completely and you're back to the original broken behavior.

  configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
  python version = 2.7.13 (default, May 10 2017, 20:04:28) [GCC 6.3.1 20161221 (Red Hat 6.3.1-1)]

CONFIGURATION
default configuration
OS / ENVIRONMENT
This seems independent of versions, but I see it when running from Fedora while controlling Fedora, CentOS 7,  and RHEL 7 machines with Jenkins 1.651.3 running on them.
SUMMARY
Some plugins, after being installed, are either not installed to the latest version (despite no value being specified for the version) or are not installed at all, despite the module reporting success. On subsequent runs, these same plugins continue to report a changed/updated edition despite there being no change in the version being installed.
An example of some plugins where this behavior has been noticed:

antisamy-markup-formatter (version 1.1 installed, despite 1.5 being available)
scriptler (reports installed, but the plugin fails to be installed)
dynamic-parameter (same as scriptler)

And many others. However, the behavior does not affect all plugins.
STEPS TO REPRODUCE
On clean CentOS system, run the following playbook: https://gist.github.com/greg-hellings/14f58eb19a4992b910f27e53f63573b4
EXPECTED RESULTS
Plugins are installed to the latest version if version is specified as latest.
Spurious ""changed"" values are not reported from the module when nothing gets updated.
The module errors when a plugin install error occurs.
ACTUAL RESULTS
No version specified results in both plugins reporting back ""changed"" when neither the version updates (antisamy-markup-formatter) or the plugin is not installed at all (scriptler).
With the line version: latest added to that final task in the sample file, the scriptler install fails while the antisamy-markup-formatter still reports ""changed"" without actually updating anything.",3

,2072,144,,,,,"Vault bytes <=> text string API

ISSUE TYPE

Bug Report

COMPONENT NAME
lib/ansible/parsing/vault/init.py
unittests for vault
ANSIBLE VERSION

devel

SUMMARY
The new vault API is mixing bytes and text in inappropriate ways.
In working on enabling unittests for Python3, I came across the fact that vault unittests were skipping a lot of tests depending on whether they were running on python3 or python2.  Closer examination revealed that the tests were either giving different values to the API or receiving different values back depending on the version of Python that we are running on.  This is problematic API design that we need to change before release.
Good API should follow one of these rules for input and output:

Take bytes and return bytes

The old vault API attempted to use this strategy for ""internal"" functions.  Many of the functions inside of vault were not called from outside of parsing/vault/init.py.  Since they also dealt with operations involving byte strings (encoding, decoding, hexlifying, writing to disk, etc) it made sense that they dealt solely in bytes.


Take text and return text

It is relatively easy to create this sort of API in python3 as combining text and bytes leads to immediate tracebacks.  In python2, it is easy to mix this up with one of the other strategies below as ascii-only bytes and text strings will combine.  Most of ansible's current API does not follow this strategy because we don't trust that the data coming in is going to be the string type we expect.  As we secure our borders (and with python3 tests throwing errors when these are combined inappropriately) we should be able to move more API to this model.


Take either bytes or text, normalize internally, and return text

This is the strategy that a lot of the old external Vault API was taking.  We didn't trust that the rest of Ansible was properly sending us text strings so as the first step we used to_unicode and to_bytes to make sure that the string we were dealing with was the correct type.


Take either bytes or text, normalize internally, and return bytes

Old internal vault API may have taken this strategy.  For internal API we should know that our inputs are only text or only bytes but we may have been paranoid.  Since the data we passed around was often pure-ascii, this couldn't cause tracebacks.


Take either bytes or text.  If bytes were input then output bytes.  If text was input then output text

I would not recommend this for any of our Vault API.  You'll see this in some Python stdlib API like os.path.abspath() (a good usage of the strategy) or os.listdir() (a bad usage of the strategy).  It is appropriate when the purpose of the function is a straightforward text transformation and there is a need to give callers a version that works with text and a version that works with bytes.  This is not the case for Vault's internal API (where we can adapt the callers to use just one API) and it is not needed for Vault's external API (where we should probably always be returning text).  This strategy can also be used for functions which are operating inside of a larger ""native string"" data model as the code run on python2 should be taking in bytes and outputting bytes while the code on python3 is taking in text and outputting text.  Note, though, that this strategy does not validate the input or output while technically the native string model could validate that only bytes was accepted on python2 and only text was accepted on python3.



Whichever strategy is followed, be sure that the same strategy is being applied for both Python2 and Python3.  Most projects (including Ansible) are working towards a single code base that runs on both python2 and python3.  Writing API that expects different types and returns different types on one or the other hampers this overall design.
Also note, it is tempting to do validation of the strings you receive.  I'd hesitate to do that because all checks have a cost.  Even asserts which are really meant for this purpose invokes the cost because no one really runs ansible in python optimized mode where asserts are stripped out.  My general stance has been if you trust the data coming in, there's no need to validate it.  If you don't trust the data, you should use to_bytes() or to_unicode() to accept either bytes or text and normalize to the type you want to operate on.",3

,2500,148,20,2138,"Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: Cuda 7.0 and CUDNN 6.5 v4
So when I use a simple Embedding RNN Sequence to Sequence Model like this
# choose RNN/GRU/LSTM cell
        with tf.variable_scope(""train_test"", reuse=True):
            self.cell = rnn_cell.LSTMCell(self.memory_dim)

        # embedding model
        with tf.variable_scope(""train_test""):
            self.dec_outputs, self.dec_memory = seq2seq.embedding_rnn_seq2seq(\
                            self.enc_inp, self.dec_inp, self.cell, \
                            self.vocab_size, self.vocab_size, self.seq_length)
        with tf.variable_scope(""train_test"", reuse = True):
            self.dec_outputs_tst, _ = seq2seq.embedding_rnn_seq2seq(\
                            self.enc_inp, self.dec_inp, self.cell, \
                            self.vocab_size, self.vocab_size, self.seq_length, feed_previous=True)

The above implementation works perfectly, but when I just change the model from simple embedding seq2seq to Embedding Attention Seq2Seq, like this,

        # choose RNN/GRU/LSTM cell
        with tf.variable_scope(""train_test"", reuse=True):
            self.cell = rnn_cell.LSTMCell(self.memory_dim)

        with tf.variable_scope(""train_test""):
            self.dec_outputs, self.dec_memory = seq2seq.embedding_attention_seq2seq(\
                            self.enc_inp, self.dec_inp, self.cell, \
                            self.vocab_size, self.vocab_size, self.seq_length)
        with tf.variable_scope(""train_test"", reuse = True):
            self.dec_outputs_tst, _ = seq2seq.embedding_attention_seq2seq(\
                            self.enc_inp, self.dec_inp, self.cell, \
                            self.vocab_size, self.vocab_size, self.seq_length, feed_previous=True)


I get segmentation fault, with absolutely no information. My memory does not run out, neither my CPU, as I tried this with
batch_size =1 
see.memory_dim = 1

and still got the same segmentation fault.
I get the same error, and the above configuration can certainly not eat my RAM.
This is a potential bug, if I am not getting something worng. The LSTM and GRU cell just takes the size of the hidden layer as parameter, which is a scaler.

(gdb)",embedding_attention_seq2seq fails / embedding_rnn_seq2seq works,"embedding_attention_seq2seq fails / embedding_rnn_seq2seq worksEnvironment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: Cuda 7.0 and CUDNN 6.5 v4
So when I use a simple Embedding RNN Sequence to Sequence Model like this
# choose RNN/GRU/LSTM cell
        with tf.variable_scope(""train_test"", reuse=True):
            self.cell = rnn_cell.LSTMCell(self.memory_dim)

        # embedding model
        with tf.variable_scope(""train_test""):
            self.dec_outputs, self.dec_memory = seq2seq.embedding_rnn_seq2seq(\
                            self.enc_inp, self.dec_inp, self.cell, \
                            self.vocab_size, self.vocab_size, self.seq_length)
        with tf.variable_scope(""train_test"", reuse = True):
            self.dec_outputs_tst, _ = seq2seq.embedding_rnn_seq2seq(\
                            self.enc_inp, self.dec_inp, self.cell, \
                            self.vocab_size, self.vocab_size, self.seq_length, feed_previous=True)

The above implementation works perfectly, but when I just change the model from simple embedding seq2seq to Embedding Attention Seq2Seq, like this,

        # choose RNN/GRU/LSTM cell
        with tf.variable_scope(""train_test"", reuse=True):
            self.cell = rnn_cell.LSTMCell(self.memory_dim)

        with tf.variable_scope(""train_test""):
            self.dec_outputs, self.dec_memory = seq2seq.embedding_attention_seq2seq(\
                            self.enc_inp, self.dec_inp, self.cell, \
                            self.vocab_size, self.vocab_size, self.seq_length)
        with tf.variable_scope(""train_test"", reuse = True):
            self.dec_outputs_tst, _ = seq2seq.embedding_attention_seq2seq(\
                            self.enc_inp, self.dec_inp, self.cell, \
                            self.vocab_size, self.vocab_size, self.seq_length, feed_previous=True)


I get segmentation fault, with absolutely no information. My memory does not run out, neither my CPU, as I tried this with
batch_size =1 
see.memory_dim = 1

and still got the same segmentation fault.
I get the same error, and the above configuration can certainly not eat my RAM.
This is a potential bug, if I am not getting something worng. The LSTM and GRU cell just takes the size of the hidden layer as parameter, which is a scaler.

Feature request: add a local_init_feed_dict to tf.train.Scaffold. It would be useful to be able to create local variables (which are not saved or restored) and have them initialized by a tf.train.MonitoredTrainingSession with a feed_dict. In the example below, the variable X_var is forced to be part of the GLOBAL_VARIABLES collection in order to be able to initialize the variable with a feed_dict.

Now, what about the evaluation and inference sessions?
For training, I can use tf.train.MonitoredTrainingSession, but for evaluation and inference I don't see such a cozy solution and the only possibility that I see is to use tf.Session.
Regarding the actual evaluation and inference loop, I thought to use a while loop inside which the worker periodically calls  eval_model.eval(...) or  infer_model.infer(...), but this means that the evaluation is performed considering the time and not considering the global_step and the only meaning that I can give to ""periodically"" is to sleep the thread.
What do you think about this solution? Is it the correct way to asynchronously perform training, evaluation, and inference?
Alberto",Distributed training: Evaluation and inference best practices,"Distributed training: Evaluation and inference best practicesI understand tensorflow distributed training and I implemented my own script.
What I want to do now is to integrate the possibility of assigning some workers the task of asynchronously evaluate the model.
Let's say we have 6 workers, what I want to do is to use 4 of them to do asynchronous training, one to periodically evaluate the model and another one to periodically make inference on it.
My intuition to achieve this goal is to do the following:

Describe the problem
The tf.contrib.data.make_csv_dataset() is a very useful feature which allows us to convert CSV files directly into at dataset without having to use Pandas library (like shown here). However it is missing an important feature which Pandas had, that is to read a subset of the columns in the CSV file.
For example the following code:
dataset=tf.contrib.data.make_csv_dataset(file_pattern='./data/power_data/MISO_power_data1.csv',batch_size=24,shuffle=False)
dataset = dataset.batch(4)
X_iter = dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()
X_batch = X_iter.get_next()
X_batch

results in following dataset:

 'Hour_Ending': <tf.Tensor 'IteratorGetNext_9:1' shape=(?, ?) dtype=int32>,
 'Market_Day': <tf.Tensor 'IteratorGetNext_9:2' shape=(?, ?) dtype=int32>,
 'Wind_MWh': <tf.Tensor 'IteratorGetNext_9:3' shape=(?, ?) dtype=float32>}

However I don't want feature columns for 'Hour_Ending'  and  'Market_Day' in my dataset (since they are not relevant training data) . This could be done in Pandas using code below:

                         usecols=['Wind_MWh', 'Actual_Load_MWh'], nrows=24)

I know the easy solution would be to create a CSV file having only the feature columns I want. But it would be a great utility feature to add before make_csv_dataset() migrates out of contrib into core TF.

The program also completes successfully if we pass in fewer examples than CPUs in the input queue.
I realize it's somewhat awkward for python_op to call back into the tensorflow session.  However, the threading and queues section of the manual states:
""The TensorFlow Session object is multithreaded, so multiple threads can easily use the same session and run ops in parallel.""
So, I assumed that the use case I've outlined above should be supported, and it seems surprising that it works in some cases (fewer threads than CPUs) and doesn't in others (one thread per CPU).  Is this a bug, or is there some reason I shouldn't expect it to work?
As a side note, one option to work around my problems would be to break python_op into several smaller pieces and chain the intermediate results together in the tensorflow computation graph.  However, in my real pipeline, this isn't straightforward to do, since python_op's real output depends on a number of intermediate, native python data structures that aren't easily converted into tensors that could be spliced into the tensorflow graph.

The program also completes successfully if we pass in fewer examples than CPUs in the input queue.
I realize it's somewhat awkward for python_op to call back into the tensorflow session.  However, the threading and queues section of the manual states:
""The TensorFlow Session object is multithreaded, so multiple threads can easily use the same session and run ops in parallel.""
So, I assumed that the use case I've outlined above should be supported, and it seems surprising that it works in some cases (fewer threads than CPUs) and doesn't in others (one thread per CPU).  Is this a bug, or is there some reason I shouldn't expect it to work?
As a side note, one option to work around my problems would be to break python_op into several smaller pieces and chain the intermediate results together in the tensorflow computation graph.  However, in my real pipeline, this isn't straightforward to do, since python_op's real output depends on a number of intermediate, native python data structures that aren't easily converted into tensors that could be spliced into the tensorflow graph.

If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example

Modify devel-gpu to read ""FROM nvidia/cuda:8.0-cudnn5-devel"".
Run docker build -f Dockerfile.devel-gpu -t tf from the /tensorflow/tools/docker directory. (HEAD @ 4addf4b at time of posting)

What other attempted solutions have you tried?
None yet, I'm not sure how to poke Bazel. I will continue poking around after filing the issue.

I'm training the Language Model code available here: https://github.com/rafaljozefowicz/lm
I am getting a ""Data loss"" error, see below for a traceback call. I was able to find the file where the error is raised, but I am having some trouble understanding exactly what is going wrong. It seems like this is related to a checkpoint file need to populate tensorboard, however I would greatly appreciate it if someone could point me in the right direction, so I may resolve this issue.
Currently, when I look at TensorBoard, I see a global_step of 0 for the entire training duration, and I'm worried that the model is not running. All of my GPUs are fully utilized, and I have no other issues.

Describe the problem
Background
PEP 484 [1] added support for type hints in Python. These are purely annotations and are not enforced by the interpreter, however there are tools such as mypy [2] which can be run to check for consistency in the annotations. The typeshed initiative [3] has started to build external collections of type annotations for commonly used libraries.
When adding type annotations to a codebase, it is best if you can achieve near 100% coverage, otherwise uncertainty propagates out from everywhere the ""untyped"" code is called. A codebase using TF would likely struggle to gain much benefit from type-checking in any of the core code built on top of TF.
Benefits of Adding Type Annotations

The expected inputs and outputs of functions become much clearer
Code completion is able to provide more useful suggestions, boosting productivity by reducing amount of time spent referring to docs
Static analysis can uncover latent bugs (case study here[5])

Difficulties/Drawbacks

People may be encouraged to overly constrain types, removing some of the flexibility of a dynamic language. But given that Google's Python style-guide discourages ""Power Features"" [4] I would argue that striving towards code that is explicit is a similar philosophy
The protobuf compiler would need to be augmented to generate type annotations.
The Tensorflow Python codebase is huge, so at this point adding the annotations would be a huge undertaking.
Tensorflow still supports python 2.7, 3.3 and 3.4 which do not have the type annotation syntax. So if this were implemented it would probably have to be in external *.pyi files, which is harder to maintain compared to inline type annotations in the source code.

Final thoughts
I realise that this would be a major undertaking and wouldn't be likely to ship any time soon, but I'm curious to gauge Google's thoughts on this new feature in Python. I'm about to start building a new codebase from scratch and was keen to use it as a chance to try out type annotations. I probably still will give it a shot, but I suspect that unless most of the common data science libs out there adopt this standard then its usefulness will be quite limited.

edit tensorflow.g3doc.how_tos.adding_an_op import cuda_op to import cuda_op in cuda_op_test.py.

What other attempted solutions have you tried?

I tried a non CUDA example, worked fine.
I tried a diffrent cuda kernel (square operator) also failed.
I added printf to the kernel launcher and made sure it was executed.

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):Windows 10
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):source
TensorFlow version (use command below):1.11
Python version:3.6.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.17.2
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:
Exact command to reproduce:  bazel build --config=opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

Describe the problem
I can't build from source as it gives me the error
ERROR: C:/users/ivo/_bazel_ivo/xv6zejqw/external/protobuf_archive/BUILD:266:1: Executing genrule @protobuf_archive//:generate_js_well_known_types_embed failed (Illegal instruction): bash.exe failed: error executing command
Perhaps because my CPU doesnt have AVX instructions set
on my CPU Supported Instructions sets	MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, EM64T
Lack of AVX don't allow me to pip install tf>1.5
My question is how to install from source without AVX instructions set?

         batch image: [batch_size, image_height, image_width, image_channel]
         batch locations: [batch_size, num_patches, 2]
Output Tensor:
        [batch_size, num_patches, patch_height, patch_width, image_channel]
or 
        [batch_size * num_patches, patch_height, patch_width, image_channel]
Reference:
Georgis have done the similar thing and he made the a patch in v0.8.0 and only cpu supports.
https://github.com/trigeorgis/tensorflow

But when I use it in v0.10.0, it requires me to define a shape function.
I really want to use it in the future, so I am glad it can be added as a new feature.
Other solution I tried
I have tried use extract_glimpse() instead.
output_list = [[] for _ in range(batch_size)]   # create n_patch list
locations = locations/image_size  # normalize the location
for j in range(n_patch):
    patch_one = tf.image.glimpse(batch_image, tf.constant([20, 20]), locations[:, j, :], centered=False)
    for i in range(batch_size):
          output_list[i].append(patch_one[j])  # add tensor to each list
patches = tf.pack(output_list)  # pack the list to tensor, size = [batch_size, n_patch, patch_size, patch_height, image_channel]",3

The issue is:
Although this line appears to indicate that we will be making an estimation based on the feature columns supplied:

What happens is that the passed in feature_columns is unused and instead the return from the input_function supplied to fit are used.
Am I correct in thinking that if the feature_columns arg is supplied that only those columns should be used by the classifiers estimator?
That when we instantiate the classifier we are setting the feature_columns we expect to be used?
The work around for this is simply to only return the columns you need from your input function however I found this misleading.
Point in the tutorial:
Either the code or the tutorial need to be changed.

controller-manager -master localhost:8080 -etcd_servers=http://10.0.1.115:4001

Kubelet log shows (I've created an empty kubelet.conf to stop it throwing errors, not sure if necessary though):

The Accept failed: use of closed network connection is spat out indefinitely at a very high rate. All services cease to function (but timeout rather than refuse connection).
The thing of note in the logs is that in the ""Setting services"" message both redis instances are present where-as in the ""Recieved update"" message, only the project2 instance is present.
I believe that this is due to the fact that several places in pkg/proxy/config/config.go create maps keyed on service name only. Here is an example https://github.com/mikesimons/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/proxy/config/config.go#L214
Assuming I am correct, what would be the best way to fix this? It doesn't look like the keys of the maps are used anywhere so does this need to be a map at all?",Services with the same name in different namespaces cause kube-proxy to bug out,"Services with the same name in different namespaces cause kube-proxy to bug outShould it be possible to have services with the same name in different namespaces? Nothing prevents it and I suspect that it should be possible but there are assumptions in code that cause this not to function correctly.
Here are some failing tests: https://github.com/mikesimons/kubernetes/compare/proxy_namespace_clash
And here is what lead me to investigate:

but even though the pods are marked as Running they are still not quite ready yet and it takes another five minutes or so before one can make queries to Elasticsearch and see log output in Kibana.
It would be nice to describe in a pod declaration its dependencies on other services so this can be taken into account during scheudling. For example:
apiVersion: v1beta1
kind: Pod
id: kibana-pod
desiredState:
  manifest:
    version: v1beta1
    id: kibana-server
    containers:
      - name: kibana-image
        image: kubernetes/kibana:latest
        ports:
          - name: kibana-port
            containerPort: 80
        dependencies: [elasticsearch]
labels:
  app: kibana-viewer

This would delay the scheduling of this pod until the pod(s) identified by the elasticsearch service are all in the running state.",Pod dependencies on services,"Pod dependencies on servicesOne thing that is a bad experience at the moment is the bring-up behaviour of one pod that depends on another the services of another pod. For example, in my logging work the Kibana viewer (pod, service) depends on the Elasticsearch (pod, service). When I try and bring them up together from my Makefile I have an intermediate sate like this for quite a while:

i.e. the Kibana viewer fails to start up because Elasticsearch is not ready yet. Eventually things start to look better:

I hit a ""no cloud provider specified"" and the controller and apiserver never come up and am plagued with many connection refused errors when hitting 127.0.0.1:8080 even though I set KUBERNETES_PROVIDER https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/getting-started-guides/docker.md#run-it
I'm running on an Ubuntu VM and don't need cloud provider resources like the LoadBalancer type for Services - I just want a local dev k8s environment.
Here is a snippet of the logs for the mod that enables nsenter (seeing how there were issues with Secrets not working in hyperkube - see #19069 for related info )

I have a ubuntu multi-node cluster set up - running. I am able to create pods, controllers and services at will. But I am facing the issue where service name resolution is not working. As part of the guestbook example, I have created redis-slave, redis-master and frontend services. But when containers are trying to talk to each other through this service interface, it is not working.
E.g

When PHP application try and talk to redis-slave:6379 - it fails (This call dont get routed any where)
When redis slave try to synch with master using redis-master , it doesnt work.
When I try and ping redis-master from inside the container, it comes back with unknown host error.

Do you know what is missing in the set up which is causing this problem ? I do not have any DNS (skydns) running here and think that it is desirable but not needed.

,2680,144,0,14452,"Steps to Reproduce
The end goal is to create a scrolling list that automatically ""snaps"" to a given location based on the actual scroll position at which the user stops scrolling. This may not be the best solution (I'm new to Flutter), but here's the process by which I get the crash:
Wrap a ListView within a NotificationListener. Upon receiving a UserScrollNotification with ScrollDirection.idle, call the ScrollController's animateTo() method to scroll to another location (in the example here, I arbitrarily scroll to 10000.0 pixels).
Sample code
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(new MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new MaterialApp(
      title: 'Scroller issue',
      home: new MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  final _controller = new ScrollController();

  bool _didGetNotification(ScrollNotification notification) {
    if (notification is UserScrollNotification) {
      if (notification.direction.toString() == ""ScrollDirection.idle"") {
        // We've stopped scrolling... now animate automatically to the 10000-pixel spot
        _controller.animateTo(10000.0, duration: const Duration(seconds: 2), curve: Curves.elasticOut);

        /* Above works great... unless the user tries to interact with the list WHILE it's
        // animating. In this case, you end up with:
        **********************************************************************************
        Another exception was thrown: 'package:flutter/src/widgets/scrollable.dart':
          Failed assertion: line 472 pos 12: '_hold == null || _drag == null': is not true.
        ********************************************************************************** */
      }
    }
    return true;
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new Scaffold(
      body: new NotificationListener(
        onNotification: _didGetNotification,
        child: new ListView.builder(
          padding: new EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
          controller: _controller,
          itemExtent: 60.0,
          itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {
            return new Text('Item No. $index');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
It works great as long as the user only interacts with the ListView when it is idle, but if the user attempts to scroll/drag/touch the list during the animateTo() process, the following exception is raised within the Flutter Scrollable package:
'package:flutter/src/widgets/scrollable.dart': Failed assertion: line 472 pos 12: '_hold == null || _drag == null': is not true.

After this, the ListView becomes unresponsive.
I'm sure there's a better way to achieve what I'm trying to do, but the platform itself doesn't seem to recover from this. Figured I'd make a note of it.
Thanks!

Hope this helps! Thanks!",Dragging a list that is currently handling an animateTo animation throws exception,"Dragging a list that is currently handling an animateTo animation throws exceptionSteps to Reproduce
The end goal is to create a scrolling list that automatically ""snaps"" to a given location based on the actual scroll position at which the user stops scrolling. This may not be the best solution (I'm new to Flutter), but here's the process by which I get the crash:
Wrap a ListView within a NotificationListener. Upon receiving a UserScrollNotification with ScrollDirection.idle, call the ScrollController's animateTo() method to scroll to another location (in the example here, I arbitrarily scroll to 10000.0 pixels).
Sample code
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(new MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new MaterialApp(
      title: 'Scroller issue',
      home: new MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  final _controller = new ScrollController();

  bool _didGetNotification(ScrollNotification notification) {
    if (notification is UserScrollNotification) {
      if (notification.direction.toString() == ""ScrollDirection.idle"") {
        // We've stopped scrolling... now animate automatically to the 10000-pixel spot
        _controller.animateTo(10000.0, duration: const Duration(seconds: 2), curve: Curves.elasticOut);

        /* Above works great... unless the user tries to interact with the list WHILE it's
        // animating. In this case, you end up with:
        **********************************************************************************
        Another exception was thrown: 'package:flutter/src/widgets/scrollable.dart':
          Failed assertion: line 472 pos 12: '_hold == null || _drag == null': is not true.
        ********************************************************************************** */
      }
    }
    return true;
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new Scaffold(
      body: new NotificationListener(
        onNotification: _didGetNotification,
        child: new ListView.builder(
          padding: new EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
          controller: _controller,
          itemExtent: 60.0,
          itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {
            return new Text('Item No. $index');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
It works great as long as the user only interacts with the ListView when it is idle, but if the user attempts to scroll/drag/touch the list during the animateTo() process, the following exception is raised within the Flutter Scrollable package:
'package:flutter/src/widgets/scrollable.dart': Failed assertion: line 472 pos 12: '_hold == null || _drag == null': is not true.

After this, the ListView becomes unresponsive.
I'm sure there's a better way to achieve what I'm trying to do, but the platform itself doesn't seem to recover from this. Figured I'd make a note of it.
Thanks!

I/flutter ( 6315): 
I/flutter ( 6315): The overflowing RenderFlex has an orientation of Axis.vertical.
I/flutter ( 6315): The edge of the RenderFlex that is overflowing has been marked in the rendering with a yellow and
I/flutter ( 6315): black striped pattern. This is usually caused by the contents being too big for the RenderFlex.
I/flutter ( 6315): Consider applying a flex factor (e.g. using an Expanded widget) to force the children of the
I/flutter ( 6315): RenderFlex to fit within the available space instead of being sized to their natural size.
I/flutter ( 6315): This is considered an error condition because it indicates that there is content that cannot be
I/flutter ( 6315): seen. If the content is legitimately bigger than the available space, consider clipping it with a
I/flutter ( 6315): ClipRect widget before putting it in the flex, or using a scrollable container rather than a Flex,
I/flutter ( 6315): like a ListView.

Is there any way I could add a try / catch block somewhere which could remove cards from the buttonsList  until there aren't enough cards on the screen to  overflow?
try {
     /* GridView Builder */
    }catch(e){
      debugPrint('heightTooManyCards');
        _nCards = _nCards - 1;
        buttonsList = doInit();
    }
I couldn't find anywhere to catch the error message outputted in the terminal during runtime.
Any ideas on how I could fix this?
Thank you all very much!",Grid View Builder Catch RenderFlex Overflow,"Grid View Builder Catch RenderFlex OverflowI am a student who has only recently started to learn Flutter.
I have a GridView which builds a dynamic number of grids. If the devices screen is too small sometimes the number of grids overflow and this comes through to the console:
I/flutter ( 6315): ══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY RENDERING LIBRARY ╞═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
I/flutter ( 6315): The following message was thrown during layout:
I/flutter ( 6315): A RenderFlex overflowed by 120 pixels on the bottom.
I/flutter ( 6315): 
I/flutter ( 6315): The overflowing RenderFlex has an orientation of Axis.vertical.
I/flutter ( 6315): The edge of the RenderFlex that is overflowing has been marked in the rendering with a yellow and
I/flutter ( 6315): black striped pattern. This is usually caused by the contents being too big for the RenderFlex.
I/flutter ( 6315): Consider applying a flex factor (e.g. using an Expanded widget) to force the children of the
I/flutter ( 6315): RenderFlex to fit within the available space instead of being sized to their natural size.
I/flutter ( 6315): This is considered an error condition because it indicates that there is content that cannot be
I/flutter ( 6315): seen. If the content is legitimately bigger than the available space, consider clipping it with a
I/flutter ( 6315): ClipRect widget before putting it in the flex, or using a scrollable container rather than a Flex,
I/flutter ( 6315): like a ListView.

I have a pretty small application that shows a list of values from a static file. I uploaded it to iTunes Connect and downloaded it using TestFlight. Everything works just fine in my iPhone X.
I have modified the application to add a Firebase connection with a Firestore DDBB. If I run the application from Android Studio directly in my phone, it works, and it shows the data from the database. If I archive the app and upload it to iTunes Connect, and install it through TestFlight, when opening the application, it just appears as a white screen. The application works but shows nothing, but an empty white screen.
Do you know what is happening or how I can get information that can help to solve my problem?

I have a pretty small application that shows a list of values from a static file. I uploaded it to iTunes Connect and downloaded it using TestFlight. Everything works just fine in my iPhone X.
I have modified the application to add a Firebase connection with a Firestore DDBB. If I run the application from Android Studio directly in my phone, it works, and it shows the data from the database. If I archive the app and upload it to iTunes Connect, and install it through TestFlight, when opening the application, it just appears as a white screen. The application works but shows nothing, but an empty white screen.
Do you know what is happening or how I can get information that can help to solve my problem?

,2715,144,35,28984,"Steps to Reproduce
Using Android Studio. I have two different applications (one is a game, and the other is a set of widgets to better manage the space in tablets).


They were running smoothly in flutter 1.1.2 beta for devices from API 16 up to API 27, and emulators from API 21 up to API 28.


After flutter upgrade to flutter 1.2.1 beta, both applications in my device with API 16 fails at the moment of touching anything inside the application with the same error.


Then the application dies and a dialog that reads Unfortunately, <application_name> has stopped and an exception is thrown through the log file.


Both applications works fine in a Samsung Galaxy Nexus API 17 Jelly Bean MR1 and up to a Moto G5 Plus API 27, so this is a problem only in Jelly Bean API 16.


Logs
Both applications start fine. But touching anything in the screen we get the following log error:

Using Android Studio. I have two different applications (one is a game, and the other is a set of widgets to better manage the space in tablets).


They were running smoothly in flutter 1.1.2 beta for devices from API 16 up to API 27, and emulators from API 21 up to API 28.


After flutter upgrade to flutter 1.2.1 beta, both applications in my device with API 16 fails at the moment of touching anything inside the application with the same error.


Then the application dies and a dialog that reads Unfortunately, <application_name> has stopped and an exception is thrown through the log file.


Both applications works fine in a Samsung Galaxy Nexus API 17 Jelly Bean MR1 and up to a Moto G5 Plus API 27, so this is a problem only in Jelly Bean API 16.


Logs
Both applications start fine. But touching anything in the screen we get the following log error:

Steps to Reproduce
You can reproduce it doing the flutter-firebase codelab (https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-firebase/#5), using Android 8 (SDK 26). There seems to be some kind of deadlock when calling this method.
It also does not seem to work using the following versions:
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  image_picker: 0.1.1
  google_sign_in: 0.3.1
  firebase_analytics: 0.1.0
  firebase_auth: 0.2.3
  firebase_database: 0.1.0
  firebase_storage: 0.0.6
  firebase_messaging: 0.0.5
We also found out that you can sign in like this:

call _googleSignIn.signIn()
select the user
we noticed a very short flicker at the top of the screen, but that's it
if you use await _googleSignIn.signIn(), the code below is never executed
there is also no exception thrown

close the app, so that it stops running in the background
open the app again

I tested this on a OnePlus3T using the production version on the PlayStore and locally using the version in v0.5.1.
@HansMuller I think this is behind the error in #17598
Steps to Reproduce


Open the ""Contact profile"" study


Scroll the bottom of the page


Select the drop down menu in top right of the app bar and choose the ""App bar snaps"" option


Scroll up until the full app bar is displayed (screenshot attached)



Select the ""App bar floats"" option


The app will not immediately crash but it is in a bad state and further actions will cause various exceptions and crashes. Logs attached below.

I guess it is expected to be:
assert(transform.determinant() != 0.0);

However, if my guess is correct, there is another issue which causes this assertion to fail. Followed are the steps to reproduce

Replace determinant with determinant() as above;
Open project flutter_gallery in Android Studio;
Start running main.dart in Android simulator;
As the application is launched, tap 'Material -> Bottom app bar' to open the bottom app bar demo;
Tap 'None' radio in FAB shape, the Floating Action Button should disappear;
Tap 'Circular' or 'Diamond' radio in  FAB shape.

Have a method open an AlertDialog
Have a button execute the method
In a test, use await tester.tap(find.byKey(const Key('LoginBtnKey'))); to tap the button
Then verify that the dialog is shown using expect(find.byType(AlertDialog), findsOneWidget);
This gives a framework error.

So I'm having issues getting the flutter firebase_admob plugin to work on Android (Release). It initializes and loads ads perfectly for the debug build on Android and the debug/release builds on iOS. I've already made the necessary changes to the AndroidManifest.xml file and included my admob app id (See screenshot). I'm really lost at this point. I've looked at all of the available solutions for the issue I'm having and none have worked. Please help!

Yesterday, I attempted to use showDrawer with the 7be58b1 alpha branch of Flutter. The drawer appeared/dismissed correctly, and the widgets I put in the drawer were correct.
Unfortunately, I noticed that no matter how I attempted to change the state of what was drawn in the drawer, it would not re-render. In my case, I tried to put a Switch inside a DrawerItem to toggle debug mode for my app. I did confirm that the state did actually change, which led me to think that Flutter has a bug.
I was following the Stocks demo app quite closely, which uses a Drawer to toggle the user's market sentiment (Optimistic vs Pessimistic). However, I was assuming that the app's behavior would match the Sky Demo app in the Google Play Store. I only just realized that this app is actually 3 months old (last update August 25), so it is very possible that in that time, the Stocks example does not function as it did before.
I am currently unable to try running these examples (though I have found the instructions), so if someone else can run the Stocks app and determine whether the Optimistic/Pessimistic radio buttons update the drawer menu or not, that would be very helpful.

I accidentally left the ""new"" keyword out of a line of code while working on an app, and when I rebuilt it, the compiler crashed. I then created a brand new project in IntelliJ, and verified the issue still occurred.
Steps to reproduce:


Create a new IntelliJ Flutter project


IntelliJ spits out the ""increment counter"" app.


Remove the new keyword from line 67:
 66: // than having to individually change instances of widgets.
 67: return new Scaffold(
 68:   appBar: new AppBar(



Trigger a hot reload.


The compiler crashes with the message included below.


Interestingly, the compiler does not crash if you leave line 67 alone and instead remove the ""new"" keyword from line 68. Line 67 is creating the instance that's used as the return value of the method, if that matters.

• No issues found!","Compiler crash when ""new"" keyword removed from default app","Compiler crash when ""new"" keyword removed from default appSteps to Reproduce
I accidentally left the ""new"" keyword out of a line of code while working on an app, and when I rebuilt it, the compiler crashed. I then created a brand new project in IntelliJ, and verified the issue still occurred.
Steps to reproduce:


Create a new IntelliJ Flutter project


IntelliJ spits out the ""increment counter"" app.


Remove the new keyword from line 67:
 66: // than having to individually change instances of widgets.
 67: return new Scaffold(
 68:   appBar: new AppBar(



Trigger a hot reload.


The compiler crashes with the message included below.


Interestingly, the compiler does not crash if you leave line 67 alone and instead remove the ""new"" keyword from line 68. Line 67 is creating the instance that's used as the return value of the method, if that matters.

Steps to Reproduce:
just mention a color in hex format and hover arrow of the hex code, this should normally open a in-biult color picker. This is not working only in the insider version, color picker works perfectly in Visual Code.
however, whenever the color picker would appear, it would quickly close itself and very rarely it would work properly.

Steps to Reproduce:
just mention a color in hex format and hover arrow of the hex code, this should normally open a in-biult color picker. This is not working only in the insider version, color picker works perfectly in Visual Code.
however, whenever the color picker would appear, it would quickly close itself and very rarely it would work properly.

As part of engineering work we have automated major part of our smoke test. To ensure its stability, it is important to run it on different machines.
Running automated test
Prerequisites

Update stable to the latest version.
Close all VS Code instances that will be used in a test (e.g. latest insiders, stable) not to have any interference with the running test that will spawn them itself.

Once the test is running, please do not interfere with it by doing selection or focusing anywhere within spawned test VS Code instance.
Approximate running time
10 minutes minimum (the more failures it has, the more it runs due to adaptive retry strategy of the waiting time).
Procedure

Run git checkout michelkaporin/smoketest in vscode repository. Currently the code lives on my branch only.
cd test/smoke
npm install
npm test -- --latest ""path/to/binary"" --stable  ""path/to/binary"", where latest argument is the path to VS Code executable to conduct testing, and stable is previous stable version (in order to run 'Data Migration' tests). If the latter argument is ommited, 'Data Migration' tests won't run.

Example commands:
npm test -- --latest ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft VS Code Insiders\Code - Insiders.exe"" --stable ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe""
or
npm test -- --latest ""/Applications/Visual Studio Code - Insiders.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron"" --stable ""/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron""
Known problems

**#27452 bug results in very many failing tests on OS X, once that is fixed, all should pass.
Spectron spawns multiple cmd windows on Windows OS. This leads to VS Code window to be overlapped by another one. To look at what the test does you need to click on the VS Code title bar to focus on it in every test. (electron-userland/spectron#60)

If you get failing tests, please dump the log with failed error messages here.

Clicking on module.js from the call stack works correctly, so perhaps the debug adapter needs to be asked about how to resolve links in the error stackframe, and only if it doesn't know how to do it, the default should be to fallback to trying to open files?


Other use-cases would be debugging a remote target where the error stack trace would contain the file paths as installed on the remote machine and these file paths would need to be translated according to the debug configuration to the local filesystem, or otherwise opened in readonly mode by fetching their sources from nodejs

1.0.0","AutoImport not working for NPM packages, only in JS/JSX","AutoImport not working for NPM packages, only in JS/JSXIssue Type: Bug
I have this weird issue where AutoImport won't work for NPM packages when using JS or JSX. However it DOES work for:

Local files
when using Typescript instead of JS

I haven't found any issue quite like this, so I finally decided to ask for clues. Any hints at how to fix this would be greatly appreciated.

I've been benchmarking it against magento2, which contains about 30k files and 2M lines of code. If the user has ag installed in his system the process of finding those todos is quite fast, its takes about 4s to do that on my laptop.
Quite surprisingly though the bulk of the time is spent on these lines, which are executed about 1k times, since the extension creates about 1k TreeItems under these circumstances:



Adding the tooltips requires about 500 extra milliseconds, I would expect that number to be near 0ms, I see basically nothing going on here that can justify that number.


Adding the commands requires about 4 extra seconds. 4 seconds for doing what? Creating those objects should be almost free, and until those TreeItems get clicked they don't even change anything as far as the user is concerned, I think.

After installing VSCode 1.26, the GUI is almost completely unresponsive when I open my project. After a few minutes, it can be used. However, the CPU usage will remain at 24% (i have 4 cores). Even after the project or folder is closed.
If I open VSCode without a project or folder, it behaves.
VSCode is responsive if launched with --disable-extensions.
Could it be an extentions that misbehaves?

Steps to Reproduce:
I have a laptop with touchpad and scrolling (by touching the touchpad with two fingers and sliding them vertically) file content, files list, terminal window or anything inside VSCode behaves like I am pressing an holding up/down arrow keys. This behavior is not only annoying but it doesn't allow me to scroll say terminal window, because scrolling simply shows the list of last run commands - the same as if you press up arrow key multiple times. Horizontal scrolling behaves as left/right arrow keys - instead of scrolling horizontally, I move the caret. I have a wireless Microsoft mouse and when I use it for scrolling, everything works a expected. When I use my touchpad to scroll in the same way any other application like Chrome, Notepad, whatever, it behaves normally (the caret stays on its location and only the view is scrolled - actually I can normally scroll this GitHub's text area I am writing the issue text in). Does anyone have such problem with VSCode ? Could it because of touchpad drivers (I think mine is ""ELAN Pointing Device"") ?

When I use my touchpad to scroll in the same way any other application like Chrome, Notepad, whatever, it behaves normally (the caret stays on its location and only the view is scrolled - actually I can normally scroll this GitHub's text area I am writing the issue text in). Does anyone have such problem with VSCode ? Could it because of touchpad drivers (I think mine is ""ELAN Pointing Device"") ?
List of extensions:
1 Debugger for Chrome 2.7.0
2. Git History (git log) 0.2.0
3. TSLint 0.8.1
4. vscode-icons 7.4.0
I tried to disable all extensions and reload VSCode but nothing changed.
The video below is made without using arrows keys - only scrolling functionality of my touchpad.",3

There is a new setting editor.multicursorModifier. On Linux and Windows it can have the value ""ctrl"" or ""alt"". On OSX it can have the value ""cmd"" or ""alt"". Please check:

the default is ""alt"" (just as before). So without any changes, out of the box, multiple cursors are added via ""alt"" + click.

when using alt as the multicursor modifier: ctrl+click (cmd+click) is used for going to definition and opening links. ctrl+alt+click (cmd+alt+click) is used for going to definition and opening in a side editor and for opening a link in a side editor (you can craft a file:/// link to test this)

Steps to Reproduce:

Set your menu bar to auto hide (i.e. set it to toggle).
Press Alt to show the menu bar.
Click somewhere near the beginning of a line of text in your currently visible text document.
As the menu bar disappears, notice that the text gets selected, started from the position where you clicked and ending on the line below where you clicked.

Expected:
Nothing should get selected when the menu bar auto hides. The cursor should simply be wherever you clicked.
