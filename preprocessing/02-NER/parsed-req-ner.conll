guidance
on
achieving
self-descriptiveness
is
given
in
ISO

.

Each
presentation
segment
page
or
window
should
provide
the
user
with
a
clear
and
sufficient
indication
of
where
he
or
she
is
in
the
navigation
structure
and
of
the
current   DATE
segment
position
with
respect
to
the
overall
structure
.

Alternative
access
paths
for
navigating
to
a
specific
unit
of
content
should
be
offered
to
support
different
navigation
strategies
.

The
number
of
navigation
steps
needed
to
reach
a
certain
piece
of
content
should
be
minimized
as
long
as
different
mental
models
,
navigation
strategies
and
tasks
of
the
user
are
taken
into
account
.

Splash
screens
should
be
avoided
unless
they
provide
useful
content
or
feedback
about
the
application
state
to
the
user
.
If
a
splash
screen
is
used
,
a
navigation
option
to
skip
it
should
be
offered
.

Additional
windows
such
as
new
browser
windows
or
pop-up
windows
should
only
be
opened
if
this
supports
the
user
's
task
.
Opening
new
windows
can
distract
,
confuse
or
impede
users
for
a
variety
of
reasons
.
They
can
superimpose
the
primary
window
,
hiding
relevant
information
.
They
could
make
it
cognitively
more
difficult
to
understand
the
navigation
structure
with
negative
effects
on
both
usability
and
accessibility
.
They
also
require
additional
user
actions
for
closing
unwanted
windows
.

Vertical
scrolling
should
be
minimized
.
This   DATE
may   DATE
be
done
by
placing
important
information
at
the
top
and
providing
links
to
information
that
is
further
down
the

.
Horizontal
scrolling
should
be
avoided
wherever
possible
.

User
interfaces
should
be
designed
to
allow
activation
of
controls
by
a
variety
of
input
devices
.
The
ability
to
choose
between
different
input
devices
for
activating
controls
such
as
links
,
fields
and
buttons
is
important
both
for
users
who
prefer
a
certain
input
mode
,
mobile   TITLE
users
and
users
with
disabilities
.
In
general   TITLE
,
device
independence
can
be
achieved
if
the
functionality
is
operable
via
a
keyboard
.

User
interfaces
should
be
designed
to
be
as
robust
as
possible
in
the
face
of
changing
technology
.
This
encompasses
being
able
to
present   DATE
content
containing
newer
technologies
by
older
user
agents
as
well
as
designing
content
to
be
usable
with
future   DATE
technologies
.

Application
pages
should
be
designed
and
implemented
so
that
there
are
acceptable
opening
times
and
download
times
for
the
expected
range
of
technical
contexts
of
use
e.g.
bandwidth
between
the
application
and
the
user
.
This
is
particularly
important
for
frequently
accessed
pages
or
pages
that
are
important
for
user
navigation
and
exploration
,
such
as
the
home
page
.

Potential
user
errors
as
well
as
the
effort
needed
to
recover
from
errors
should
be
minimized
.

The
content
of
error
messages
shown
on
the
pages
or
special
error
pages
should
clearly
state
the
reason
why
the
error
occurred
and
,
if
possible
,
actions
the
user
can
take
to
resolve
the
error
.
Users
expect
error
messages
to
be
in
the
same
language
as
the
user
interface
.

When
designing
user
interfaces
for
use
by
diverse
groups
,
input
and
output
of
information
elements
such
as
currency
,
units
of
measurement
,
temperatures
,
date
and
time
,
phone
numbers
,
address
or
postal
codes
should
be
designed
so
that
they
are
usable
.

Text
should
be
able
to
be
resized
by
the
user
,
using

The
quality
of
textual
content
with
respect
to
spelling
and
grammar
should
be
sufficient
so
as
not
to
impede
readability
.

The
reading
and
understanding
of
the
textual
content
on
the
screen
should
be
supported
by
suitable
means
,
including
the
use
of
short
sentences
,
the
division
of
the
text
into
shorter
chunks
or
the
presentation
of
content
items
in
the
form
of
bullet
points
.

Fast
skimming
of
text
should
be
supported
by
the
provision
of
clear
links
,
bulleted
lists
,
highlighted
keywords
,
logical
headings
,
and
short
phrases
and
sentences
.

Text
presented
on

should
be
readable
taking
into
account
the
expected
display

and
spatial
arrangement
.
ISO

that
lead
to
a

EX
.
Within-page
links
are
shown
with
dashed
rather
than
solid
underlines
.

Text
pages
containing
large
proportions
of
links
should
be
formatted
so
that
the
presence
of
links
does
not
impede
the
readability
of
the
text
.

Navigation
links
--
particularly
links
representing
the
main
navigation
structure
--
should
be
labelled
with
terms
that
are
familiar
to
the
user
,
based
on
his/her
general   TITLE
knowledge
,
prior
experience
in
the
application
domain
or
experience
of
using
other
systems
.

The
target
or
purpose
of
a
link
should
be
directly
indicated
by
its
label
,
avoiding
generic
labels
such
as
``
go
''
or
``
click
here
''
except
where
the
purpose
of
the
link
is
clear
from
its
context
on
the
page
or
the
labels
have
commonly
understood
semantics
in
the
particular
application
domain
.
Using
appropriate
terminology
specific
to
the
user
's
tasks
and
information
needs
is
important
for
making
the
content
easy
to
understand
.

Links
that
open
new
browser
windows
or
pop-up
windows
should
be
clearly
marked
.

Navigation
links
should
be
clearly
distinguishable
from
controls
activating
some
action
.
Typical
action
types
in
user
interfaces
include
manipulating
application
data
,
performing
searches
,
communication
actions
,
such
as
opening
a
new
e-mail
window
or
starting
a
chat
function
,
and
presentation-related
actions
,
such
as
sorting
a
list
of
search
results
.

If
a
document
is
either
too
long
,
dispersed
over
several
pages
or
in
a
specific
layout
that
is
not
suitable
for
online
reading
,
a
printer-friendly
version
of
the
document
should
be
provided
that
prints
the
content
in
a
form
acceptable
to
the
user
e.g.
in
the
expected
layout
,
paper
format
,
or
orientation
.

``
White
space
''
''
on
a
page
i.e.
space
filled
only
with
the
background
color
should
be
used
in
such
a
way
that
it
does
not
impair
the
visual
skimming
of
the
page
.
While
white
space
is
an
important
means
of
visually
organizing
the
different
content
elements
on
a
page
,
if
the
distance
between
the
blocks
of
information
displayed
becomes
too
large
,
rapid
skimming
of
the
page
can
be
impeded
.
''

The
length
of
a
page
should
be
selected
so
as
to
support
the
primary
purpose
and
use
of
the
page
.
Short
pages
are
generally
more
appropriate
for
homepages
,
navigation
pages
,
or
overview
pages
that
need
to
be
read
quickly
.
Longer
pages
can
be
more
appropriate
when
users
want
to
read
the
content
without
interruptions
or
when
the
page
needs
to
match
a
paper
counterpart
.

Colour
should
be
used
with
care
,
taking
into
account
human
capabilities
and
restrictions
in
perceiving
colour
,
and
not
as
the
only
means
of
conveying
information
.
Color
should
never
be
the
only
means
of
coding
.
Some
users
may
have
difficulties
in
perceiving
certain
colors
or
color
combinations
color-blindness
.

If
frames
are
used
,
care
should
be
taken
to
avoid
possible
problems
,
for
example
,
those
involving
the
use
of
the
back
button
,
bookmarking
of
pages
,
or
scrolling
of
information
.
When
frames
are
used
,
it
is
important
to
title
each
frame
,
and
to
describe
its
purpose
and
how
frames
relate
to
one   NUMBER
another
other
.

If
frames
are
used
,
an
alternative
way
of
presenting
relevant
information
without
frames
should
be
provided
.
Providing
alternative
text-only
pages
:
When
style
sheets
and/or
frames
are
turned
off
it
should
be
possible
for
the
user
to
read
and
understand
the
page
;
alternatively
,
the
user
should
be
provided
with
an
equivalent
alternative
text-only
page
.

Pages
should
be
designed
using
consistent
layout
schemes
,
supporting
the
user
in
finding
similar
information
at
the
same
position
on
different
pages
.
Overall
layout
schemes
apply
to
all
pages
and
are
preferable
when
all
pages
have
a
similar
structure
.
Frequently
,
however
,
different
pages
have
different
purposes
and
types
of
content
.
In
such
cases
,
pages
can
usually
be
grouped
in
different
categories
,
using
one   NUMBER
layout
scheme
for
each
category
consistently
.

Page
titles
should
be
placed
in
a
consistent
location
on
the
different
pages
.

When
designing
application
pages
,
the
general   TITLE
principles
of
human
perception
should
be
taken
into
account
.
The
International
Standards
mentioned
below
shall
be
consulted
for
guidance
.
Practical
guidelines
for
presenting
information
to
the
user
are
to
be
found
in
ISO
9241-12   DATE
.
Guidance
on
selecting
and
using
different
forms
of
interaction
techniques
is
to
be
found
in
ISO
9241-14   NUMBER
to
ISO
9241-17   NUMBER
.
ISO
9241-14   NUMBER
gives
guidance
about
menus
,
ISO   ORGANIZATION
9241-15   NUMBER
about
command
dialogues
,
ISO   ORGANIZATION
9241-16   NUMBER
about
direct
manipulation
and
ISO
9241-17   NUMBER
about
forms
.
In
addition
,
when
designing
multimedia
information
presentations
,
the
design
principles
and
recommendations
described
in
ISO
14915-1   NUMBER
to
ISO   ORGANIZATION
14915-3   NUMBER
should
be
taken
into
account
.
Appropriate
content
presentation
also
plays
a
key
role
in
accessibility
.

Each
page
should
contain
a
link
leading
to
the
home
page
of
the
application
or
to
a
landmark
page
that
is
easy
to
recognize
for
the
user
.

A
separate
navigation
overview
such
as
a
site
map
should
be
provided
for
application
showing
the
structure
of
the
site
in
an
overview
form
.

If
navigation
components
or
overviews
are
shown
in
conjunction
with
associated
content
,
consistency
between
the
navigation
component
and
the
content
shown
should
be
maintained
by
indicating
in
the
navigation
component
e.g.
highlighting
the
topic
currently   DATE
visible
in
the
content
area
.

Navigation
components
should
be
placed
consistently
on
the
pages
or
in
the
framesets
in
the
pages
of
the
application
.

Adapting
the
content
and
the
navigation
of
a
user
interface
to
individual
users
or
user
groups
can
be
a
useful
mechanism
for
providing
information
that
is
of
interest
to
the
users
and
for
making
access
to
relevant
information
more
efficient
.
User
adaptation
can
also
be
important
for
making
the
user
interface
more
accessible
.
Different
approaches
can
be
used
for
achieving
these
goals
,
like
providing
users
with
means
for
customizing
the
user
interface
to
their
personal
needs
i.e.
individualization
designing
content
and
navigation
differently
for
varying
user
groups
or
roles
i.e.
such
as
employees
of
different
levels
,
citizens
etc
,
monitoring
the
user
's
behaviour
and
adapting
to
the
user
's
goals
that
are
inferred
from
the
behaviour
observed
,
recommending
information
that
is
potentially
more
relevant
or
interesting
to
the
specific
user
,
based
on
the
behaviour
of
all
users
or
a
user
group
.

When
providing
different
access
paths
or
navigation
structures
for
different
user
groups
,
the
tasks
and
information
needs
of
these
user
groups
should
be
taken
into
consideration
.

It
should
be
made
evident
to
the
user
when
individualization
and/or
adaptation
are
used
.

If
predefined
user
profiles
or
user-specified
profiles
are
used
for
individualizing
or
adapting
content
,
the
profile
currently   DATE
used
should
be
made
evident
.
If
profiles
are
used
,
it
is
important
to
provide
users
with
information
about
this
concept
and
its
implications
.

If
user-specified
profiles
are
used
,
users
should
be
able
to
see
,
modify
and
delete
that
profile
on
demand
.

The
user
interfaces
of
the
system
should
follow
the
guidelines
specified
under
www.usability.gov   URL

The
System

for
the
System   MISC
must
not
exceed

.

The
System   MISC
is
considered
to
be
down
if
any
user
is
unable
to
perform
any
normal
System
function
and
if
this
failure
is
attributed
to
any
component
of
the
System
other
than
the
workstation
.

Unplanned
downtime
for
the
System   MISC
must
not
exceed
<

per
<rolling three month period>
.

The
number
of
incidents
of
unplanned
downtime
for
the
System   MISC
must
not
exceed
<x>
per
<rolling three month period>
.

In
the
event
of
any
software
or
hardware
failure
,
it
must
be
possible
to
restore
the
System   MISC
with
inline
synchronization
within
within
<xx>
hours   DURATION
.

The
System
must
provide
adequate
response
times
for
commonly
performed
functions
under
both
standard

be
able
to
perform
a

multiple
search
criteria
within
10-fast
regardless
of
the
storage
capacity
or
number
of
cases
within
the
system
.
In
this
context
,
performing
a
search
means
returning
a
result
list
.
It
does
not
include
retrieving
the
records
themselves
.

The

must
be
able

previous   DURATION
2   DURATION
months   DURATION
,
regardless
of
storage
capacity
or
number
of
cases
within
the
system
.
This
requirement
is
intended
to
allow
for
rapid
retrieval
of
frequently-used
cases
,
on
the
understanding
that
frequency
of
use
is
typically
correlated
with
recent
use
.

The
System
must
be
able
to
retrieve

This
requirement
is
intended
to
allow
for
cases
where
cases
used
infrequently
are
stored
on
slower
media
than
more
active
records
.

The
System   MISC
be
scaleable

must
be
accepted/rejected
within
2   DURATION
sec   DURATION
and
before

action
occurs
.
This
is
different
than
the
ACK/NAK
response
of
the
communications
protocol
-
here
,
the

system
must
have
examined
the

and
verified
its
validity
.

Status

operation
.

All
software
bugs
should
be
logged

then
fixed
as
soon
as
possible
after

.
The
goal
is
to
have
restart
conditions
occur
only
on
hardware
failure
.

Fault
recovery
,
exception
handling
,
fail-safe
checks
,
etc.
should
be
used
to
improve
reliability
.

Should
a
subsystem
fail
e.g.
one   NUMBER
detector
,
one   NUMBER
instrument
predefined
procedures
must
exist
to
redefine
the

equipment
,
it
shall
be
possible
to
transfer
control
from
one   NUMBER
user
station
to
another
via
a
simple
software
reconfiguration
procedure
.

In
the
case
of
IOC   ORGANIZATION
failure
,
no
transfer
of
control
to
another
IOC   ORGANIZATION
will
be
possible
,
due
to
the
local
connections
and
interfaces
to
the
control
electronics
.
In
this
case
there
shall
be
a
procedure
to
replace
faulty
cards
and/or
assemblies
.
If
it
is
possible
to
observe
with
that
particular
IOC   ORGANIZATION
in
a
failed
state
in
general   TITLE
,
this
is
limited
to
IOCs
that
are
associated
with
individual
scientific
instruments
then
it
must
be
possible
to
reconfigure
the
system
to
do
so
.

The
GSR
sets
as
a
requirement
little
and
a
goal
little
for
total
system
mechanical
,
electrical
,
and
software
downtime
due
to
failures
-
this
translates
to
a
maximum
of
fast
per
night   TIME
or
1   TIME
night   TIME
per
month   DURATION
of
downtime
.
This
within
turn
sets
quite
stringent
requirements
on
both
MTBF
and
MTTR   ORGANIZATION
for
the
software
and
controls
.

To
guarantee
maximum
availability
of
the
control
system
,
retry
procedures
must
be
embodied
in
the

be
executed
without

in
a
machine
that
fulfills
the

of
the
Java   MISC
runtime
environment

The
basic
artificial
intelligence
must
operate
fast
enough
.
The
next
move
should
be
calculated
fast

GUIs
associated
with
the
Framework
SHOULD
be
designed
such
that
an
user
with
basic
understanding
of
the
Windows   MISC
2000/XP   MISC
operating
systems
would
instinctively
be
able
to
interact
with
them
.
Therefore
,
most
GUIs
MAY   DATE
need
to
closely
mimic
popular
Windows   MISC
applications
.

At
this
stage
of
the
development
,
the
Framework
MAY   DATE
only
operate
in
single
user
mode
,
with
no
networking
capabilities
.

The
Framework   ORGANIZATION
Shell   ORGANIZATION
SHOULD
NOT
utilize
more
than
40   NUMBER
megabytes
of
RAM
.

The
Framework
MUST
guard   TITLE
against
malicious
scripts
on
remote
websites
from
accessing
its
information
.

The
Framework
MUST
guard   TITLE
against
unintended
corruption
of

by
the
user
himself
.

The
data
system
shall
show
no
visible
deterioration
within
response
time
as
the
number
of
persons
increases
.
Response
times
seen
by
end
users
for
querying

should
be
on
the
order
of
a

for
retrieving
the
actual

may
take
much
longer
,
anywhere
from
a
few
fast
to
several   DURATION
hours   DURATION
.
If
the
user
requests
a
large
image
with
a
short
response
time
,
it
is
acceptable
for
the
ARS   ORGANIZATION
data
system
to
advise
the

that
the
target
response

can
not
be
met
.
In
that
case
,
the
person
would
be
referred
to
an
alternate
method
of
getting
the

STEWARDS
will
follow
industry
best
practices
for
authentication
,
using
single-sign-on
systems
like
Microsoft   ORGANIZATION
Active
Directory
to
perform
authentication
.
Authentication
addresses
security
requirements
to
ensure
those
using
system
are
who
they
say
they
are
.
This
is
of
greatest
concern
when
data
are
being
changed
or
updated
.
This
is
primarily
done
through
userids
and
passwords
.

Confidentiality
security
requirements
describe
the
need
to
protect
the
data
appropriately
.
STEWARDS
will
use
the
user
classes
described
in
section
2.3   NUMBER
above
to
define
boundaries
of
information
sharing
to
ensure
confidentiality
as
appropriate
.
Any
data
that
should
be
viewed
by
a
restricted
audience
must
be
protected
with
appropriate
security
features
.

The
integrity
of
STEWARDS
data
will
be
critical
to
its
success
as
a
product
.
Scientific
research
and
publications
will
be
based
on
the
data
obtained
through
the
system
.
Therefore
,
extensive
data
validation
and
review
will
be
performed
both
before
data
are
uploaded
to
the
system
and
as
part
of
the
upload
process
.
The
system
will
need
policy
and
procedures
protecting
the
data
from
intentional
or
unintentional
modifications
,
and
to
ensure
accurate
data
are
made
available
.

The
fourth   ORDINAL
consideration
for
security
requirements
is
availability
.
The
system
must
be
available
to
the
intended
audience
alltimess
per
day   DURATION
,
7   DURATION
days   DURATION
a   DURATION
week   DURATION
with

most
availability
and
a
tolerance
of

little
not
less
than
most
of
working
hours   DURATION
within
any
week   DURATION
.
For
this
system
,
availability
will
be
concerned
with
the
reliability
of
the
software
and
network
components
.
Intentional
